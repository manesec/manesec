I'm an IMEL student still studying at macau, interested the pentest skill and to be a hacker, but is a good man. 

I am standing in the red team, so it need some time to learn about that.

The reality is that I am very busy, even sleep time is very limited, Give me some time to update the github, also I'm lazy. 

(This is what I want to say but I don't wanna say it 🙃)
